All the homework assignment scripts in this module have been coded in a reusable way for multiple datasets

file paths and names have to be supplied by the user (as instructed by the TA Edward -either as arguments or user prompts) and are not hardcoded in the script.

Each assignment's readme will give specific instructions pertaining to that script
